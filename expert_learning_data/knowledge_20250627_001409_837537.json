Start a new pool named 'www'.\n; the variable $pool can be used in any directive and will be replaced by the\n; pool name ('www' here)\n[www]\n\n; Per pool prefix\n; It only applies on the following directives:\n; - 'access.log'\n; - 'slowlog'\n; - 'listen' (unixsocket)\n; - 'chroot'\n; - 'chdir'\n; - 'php_values'\n; - 'php_admin_values'\n; When not set, the global prefix (or /usr) applies instead.\n; Note: This directive can also be relative to the global prefix.\n; Default Value: none\n;prefix = /path/to/pools/$pool\n\n; Unix user/group of processes\n; Note: The user is mandatory. If the group is not set, the default user's group\n;       will be used.\nuser = www-data\ngroup = www-data\n\n; The address on which to accept FastCGI requests.\n; Valid syntaxes are:\n;   'ip.add.re.ss:port'    - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific IPv4 address on\n;                            a specific port;\n;   '[ip:6:addr:ess]:port' - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific IPv6 address on\n;                            a specific port;\n;   'port'                 - to listen on a TCP socket to all addresses\n;                            (IPv6 and IPv4-mapped) on a specific port;\n;   '/path/to/unix/socket' - to listen on a unix socket.\n; Note: This value is mandatory.\n;listen = /var/run/php/php-fpm.sock\nlisten = 127.0.0.1:9000\n; Set listen(2) backlog.\n; Default Value: 511 (-1 on FreeBSD and OpenBSD)\n;listen.backlog = 511\n\n; Set permissions for unix socket, if one is used. In Linux, read/write\n; permissions must be set in order to allow connections from a web server. Many\n; BSD-derived systems allow connections regardless of permissions.\n; Default Values: user and group are set as the running user\n;                 mode is set to 0660\nlisten.owner = www-data\nlisten.group = www-data\nlisten.mode = 0660\n; When POSIX Access Control Lists are supported you can set them using\n; these options, value is a comma separated list of user/group names.\n; When set, listen.owner and listen.group are ignored\n;listen.acl_users =\n;listen.acl_groups =\n\n; List of addresses (IPv4/IPv6) of FastCGI clients which are allowed to connect.\n; Equivalent to the FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS environment variable in the original\n; PHP FCGI (5.2.2+).

It allows to create process\n; core dump and ptrace the process for the pool user.\n; Default Value: no\n; process.dumpable = yes\n\n; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.\n; Possible Values:\n;   static  - a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;\n;   dynamic - the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the\n;             following directives. With this process management, there will be\n;             always at least 1 children.\n;             pm.max_children      - the maximum number of children that can\n;                                    be alive at the same time.\n;             pm.start_servers     - the number of children created on startup.\n;             pm.min_spare_servers - the minimum number of children in 'idle'\n;                                    state (waiting to process).

Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.\n; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP\n; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't\n; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.\n; Note: Used when pm is set to 'static', 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'\n; Note: This value is mandatory.\npm.max_children = 5\n\n; The number of child processes created on startup.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Default Value: min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2\npm.start_servers = 2\n\n; The desired minimum number of idle server processes.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'\npm.min_spare_servers = 1\n\n; The desired maximum number of idle server processes.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'\npm.max_spare_servers = 3\n\n; The number of seconds after which an idle process will be killed.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'ondemand'\n; Default Value: 10s\n;pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s;\n\n; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.\n; This can be useful to work around memory leaks in 3rd party libraries. For\n; endless request processing specify '0'. Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS.\n; Default Value: 0\n;pm.max_requests = 500\n\n; The URI to view the FPM status page. If this value is not set, no URI will be\n; recognized as a status page. It shows the following informations:\n;   pool                 - the name of the pool;\n;   process manager      - static, dynamic or ondemand;\n;   start time           - the date and time FPM has started;\n;   start since          - number of seconds since FPM has started;\n;   accepted conn        - the number of request accepted by the pool;\n;   listen queue         - the number of request in the queue of pending\n;                          connections (see backlog in listen(2));\n;   max listen queue     - the maximum number of requests in the queue\n;                          of pending connections since FPM has started;\n;   listen queue len     - the size of the socket queue of pending connections;\n;   idle processes       - the number of idle processes;\n;   active processes     - the number of active processes;\n;   total processes      - the number of idle + active processes;\n;   max active processes - the maximum number of active processes since FPM\n;                          has started;\n;   max children reached - number of times, the process limit has been reached,\n;                          when pm tries to start more children (works only for\n;                          pm 'dynamic' and 'ondemand');\n; Value are updated in real time.\n; Example output:\n;   pool:                 www\n;   process manager:      static\n;   start time:           01/Jul/2011:17:53:49 +0200\n;   start since:          62636\n;   accepted conn:        190460\n;   listen queue:         0\n;   max listen queue:     1\n;   listen queue len:     42\n;   idle processes:       4\n;   active processes:     11\n;   total processes:      15\n;   max active processes: 12\n;   max children reached: 0\n;\n; By default the status page output is formatted as text/plain. Passing either\n; 'html', 'xml' or 'json' in the query string will return the corresponding\n; output syntax. Example:\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml\n;\n; By default the status page only outputs short status. Passing 'full' in the\n; query string will also return status for each pool process.\n; Example:\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json&amp;full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html&amp;full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml&amp;full\n; The Full status returns for each process:\n;   pid                  - the PID of the process;\n;   state                - the state of the process (Idle, Running, ...);\n;   start time           - the date and time the process has started;\n;   start since          - the number of seconds since the process has started;\n;   requests             - the number of requests the process has served;\n;   request duration     - the duration in µs of the requests;\n;   request method       - the request method (GET, POST, ...);\n;   request URI          - the request URI with the query string;\n;   content length       - the content length of the request (only with POST);\n;   user                 - the user (PHP_AUTH_USER) (or '-' if not set);\n;   script               - the main script called (or '-' if not set);\n;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because memory calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n; If the process is in Idle state, then informations are related to the\n; last request the process has served. Otherwise informations are related to\n; the current request being served.\n; Example output:\n;   ************************\n;   pid:                  31330\n;   state:                Running\n;   start time:           01/Jul/2011:17:53:49 +0200\n;   start since:          63087\n;   requests:             12808\n;   request duration:     1250261\n;   request method:       GET\n;   request URI:          /test_mem.php?N=10000\n;   content length:       0\n;   user:                 -\n;   script:               /home/fat/web/docs/php/test_mem.php\n;   last request cpu:     0.00\n;   last request memory:  0\n;\n; Note: There is a real-time FPM status monitoring sample web page available\n;       It's available in: /usr/share/php/7.2/fpm/status.html\n;\n; Note: The value must start with a leading slash (/).

Some exemples:\n;      - server specifics like: %{REQUEST_METHOD}e or %{SERVER_PROTOCOL}e\n;      - HTTP headers like: %{HTTP_HOST}e or %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}e\n;  %f: script filename\n;  %l: content-length of the request (for POST request only)\n;  %m: request method\n;  %M: peak of memory allocated by PHP\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{bytes}M (default)\n;      - %{kilobytes}M\n;      - %{kilo}M\n;      - %{megabytes}M\n;      - %{mega}M\n;  %n: pool name\n;  %o: output header\n;      it must be associated with embraces to specify the name of the header:\n;      - %{Content-Type}o\n;      - %{X-Powered-By}o\n;      - %{Transfert-Encoding}o\n;      - ....\n;  %p: PID of the child that serviced the request\n;  %P: PID of the parent of the child that serviced the request\n;  %q: the query string\n;  %Q: the '?' character if query string exists\n;  %r: the request URI (without the query string, see %q and %Q)\n;  %R: remote IP address\n;  %s: status (response code)\n;  %t: server time the request was received\n;      it can accept a strftime(3) format:\n;      %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z (default)\n;      The strftime(3) format must be encapsuled in a %{&lt;strftime_format&gt;}t tag\n;      e.g. for a ISO8601 formatted timestring, use: %{%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z}t\n;  %T: time the log has been written (the request has finished)\n;      it can accept a strftime(3) format:\n;      %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z (default)\n;      The strftime(3) format must be encapsuled in a %{&lt;strftime_format&gt;}t tag\n;      e.g. for a ISO8601 formatted timestring, use: %{%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z}t\n;  %u: remote user\n;\n; Default: \"%R - %u %t \\\"%m %r\\\" %s\"\n;access.format = \"%R - %u %t \\\"%m %r%Q%q\\\" %s %f %{mili}d %{kilo}M %C%%\"\n\n; The log file for slow requests\n; Default Value: not set\n; Note: slowlog is mandatory if request_slowlog_timeout is set\n;slowlog = log/$pool.log.slow\n\n; The timeout for serving a single request after which a PHP backtrace will be\n; dumped to the 'slowlog' file. A value of '0s' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_slowlog_timeout = 0\n\n; Depth of slow log stack trace.\n; Default Value: 20\n;request_slowlog_trace_depth = 20\n\n; The timeout for serving a single request after which the worker process will\n; be killed. This option should be used when the 'max_execution_time' ini option\n; does not stop script execution for some reason. A value of '0' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_terminate_timeout = 0\n\n; Set open file descriptor rlimit.\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_files = 1024\n\n; Set max core size rlimit.\n; Possible Values: 'unlimited' or an integer greater or equal to 0\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_core = 0\n\n; Chroot to this directory at the start. This value must be defined as an\n; absolute path. When this value is not set, chroot is not used.\n; Note: you can prefix with '$prefix' to chroot to the pool prefix or one\n; of its subdirectories. If the pool prefix is not set, the global prefix\n; will be used instead.\n; Note: chrooting is a great security feature and should be used whenever\n;       possible. However, all PHP paths will be relative to the chroot\n;       (error_log, sessions.save_path, ...).\n; Default Value: not set\n;chroot =\n\n; Chdir to this directory at the start.\n; Note: relative path can be used.\n; Default Value: current directory or / when chroot\n;chdir = /var/www\n\n; Redirect worker stdout and stderr into main error log. If not set, stdout and\n; stderr will be redirected to /dev/null according to FastCGI specs.\n; Note: on highloaded environement, this can cause some delay in the page\n; process time (several ms).\n; Default Value: no\n;catch_workers_output = yes\n\n; Clear environment in FPM workers\n; Prevents arbitrary environment variables from reaching FPM worker processes\n; by clearing the environment in workers before env vars specified in this\n; pool configuration are added.\n; Setting to \"no\" will make all environment variables available to PHP code\n; via getenv(), $_ENV and $_SERVER.\n; Default Value: yes\n;clear_env = no\n\n; Limits the extensions of the main script FPM will allow to parse. This can\n; prevent configuration mistakes on the web server side. You should only limit\n; FPM to .php extensions to prevent malicious users to use other extensions to\n; execute php code.\n; Note: set an empty value to allow all extensions.\n; Default Value: .php\n;security.limit_extensions = .php .php3 .php4 .php5 .php7\n\n; Pass environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH. All $VARIABLEs are taken from\n; the current environment.\n; Default Value: clean env\n;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME\n;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n;env[TMP] = /tmp\n;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp\n;env[TEMP] = /tmp\n\n; Additional php.ini defines, specific to this pool of workers. These settings\n; overwrite the values previously defined in the php.ini. The directives are the\n; same as the PHP SAPI:\n;   php_value/php_flag             - you can set classic ini defines which can\n;                                    be overwritten from PHP call 'ini_set'.\n;   php_admin_value/php_admin_flag - these directives won't be overwritten by\n;                                     PHP call 'ini_set'\n; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no.\n\n; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from\n; extension_dir. Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' will not\n; overwrite previously defined php.ini values, but will append the new value\n; instead.\n\n; Note: path INI options can be relative and will be expanded with the prefix\n; (pool, global or /usr)\n\n; Default Value: nothing is defined by default except the values in php.ini and\n;                specified at startup with the -d argument\n;php_admin_value[sendmail_path] = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i -f www@my.domain.com\n;php_flag[display_errors] = off\n;php_admin_value[error_log] = /var/log/fpm-php.www.log\n;php_admin_flag[log_errors] = on\n;php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 32M\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>knowing me I'm missing something in my nginx config.</p>\n\n<p>let me know if you require any additional ls-l or cat of any files thanks :)</p>\n",
