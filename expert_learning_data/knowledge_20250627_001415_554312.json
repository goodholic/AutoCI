  "content": "Q: MVVM: Tutorial from start to finish?\n\nA: <p>I'm a C#/Windows Forms programmer with more than 5 years experience. I've been investigating WPF using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. I have searched the Internet for tutorials. I have even watched the entirety of Jason Dolinger's awesome video. Although I have found many, I have not found one that takes me from start to finish. What I really want is a tutorial that doesn't assume any previous WPF knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>What are your favorite WPF-MVVM tutorials that helped you to learn?</p>\n",
