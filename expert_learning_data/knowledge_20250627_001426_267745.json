We provide implementations (based on PyTorch)\nof state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily\ntrain intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games. Researchers can also use the\nprovided simple-to-use Python API to train Agents using reinforcement learning,\nimitation learning, neuroevolution, or any other methods. These trained agents can be\nused for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of\nsettings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds\nand evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. The ML-Agents\nToolkit is mutually beneficial for both game developers and AI researchers as it\nprovides a central platform where advances in AI can be evaluated on Unity’s\nrich environments and then made accessible to the wider research and game\ndeveloper communities.\n\n## Features\n- 17+ [example Unity environments](Learning-Environment-Examples.md)\n- Support for multiple environment configurations and training scenarios\n- Flexible Unity SDK that can be integrated into your game or custom Unity scene\n- Support for training single-agent, multi-agent cooperative, and multi-agent\n  competitive scenarios via several Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (PPO, SAC, MA-POCA, self-play).\n- Support for learning from demonstrations through two Imitation Learning algorithms (BC and GAIL).\n- Quickly and easily add your own [custom training algorithm](Python-Custom-Trainer-Plugin.md) and/or components.\n- Easily definable Curriculum Learning scenarios for complex tasks\n- Train robust agents using environment randomization\n- Flexible agent control with On Demand Decision Making\n- Train using multiple concurrent Unity environment instances\n- Utilizes the [Inference Engine](Inference-Engine.md) to\n  provide native cross-platform support\n- Unity environment [control from Python](Python-LLAPI.md)\n- Wrap Unity learning environments as a [gym](Python-Gym-API.md) environment\n- Wrap Unity learning environments as a [PettingZoo](Python-PettingZoo-API.md) environment\n\nSee our [ML-Agents Overview](ML-Agents-Overview.md) page for detailed\ndescriptions of all these features. Or go straight to our [web docs](https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/).\n## Releases & Documentation\n\n**Our latest, stable release is `Release 22`.

Remember to always use the\n  documentation that corresponds to the release version you're using.\n- The `com.unity.ml-agents` package is [verified](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/pack-safe.html)\n  for Unity 2020.1 and later. Verified packages releases are numbered 1.0.x.\n\n|        **Version**         | **Release Date** | **Source** | **Documentation** | **Download** | **Python Package** | **Unity Package**
