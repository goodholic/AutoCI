You can use **File-Extract file** or **File-Extract folder** to extract AssetBundles to another folder, and then read.\n\n### Extract/Decompress AssetBundles\n\nUse **File-Extract file** or **File-Extract folder**.\n\n### Export Assets\n\nuse **Export** menu.\n\n### Export Model\n\nExport model from \"Scene Hierarchy\" using the **Model** menu.\n\nExport Animator from \"Asset List\" using the **Export** menu.\n\n#### With AnimationClip\n\nSelect model from \"Scene Hierarchy\" then select the AnimationClip from \"Asset List\", using **Model-Export selected objects with AnimationClip** to export.\n\nExport Animator will export bound AnimationClip or use **Ctrl** to select Animator and AnimationClip from \"Asset List\", using **Export-Export Animator with selected AnimationClip** to export.\n\n### Export MonoBehaviour\n\nWhen you select an asset of the MonoBehaviour type for the first time, AssetStudio will ask you the directory where the assembly is located, please select the directory where the assembly is located, such as the `Managed` folder.\n\n#### For Il2Cpp\n\nFirst, use my another program [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) to generate dummy dll, then when using AssetStudio to select the assembly directory, select the dummy dll folder.\n\n## Build\n\n* Visual Studio 2022 or newer\n* **AssetStudioFBXNative** uses [FBX SDK 2020.2.1](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-2-1), before building, you need to install the FBX SDK and modify the project file, change include directory and library directory to point to the FBX SDK directory\n\n## Open source libraries used\n\n### Texture2DDecoder\n* [Ishotihadus/mikunyan](https://github.com/Ishotihadus/mikunyan)\n* [BinomialLLC/crunch](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/crunch)\n* [Unity-Technologies/crunch](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch/tree/unity)\n",
