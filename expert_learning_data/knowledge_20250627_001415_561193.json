Is using <code>-=</code> to the same event handler enough?</li>\n<li>Are there common design patterns or best practices for handling situations like this?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, how am I supposed to handle an application that has many different threads, using many different event handlers to raise several events on the UI?</p>\n<p>Are there any good and simple ways to monitor this efficiently in an already built big application?</p>\n",
