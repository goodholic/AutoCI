  "content": "Q: Why no Reference Counting + Garbage Collection in C#?\n\nA: <p>I come from a C++ background and I've been working with C# for about a year.  Like many others I'm flummoxed as to why deterministic resource management is not built-in to the language.  Instead of deterministic destructors we have the dispose pattern. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/752344\">People start to wonder</a> whether spreading the IDisposable cancer through their code is worth the effort.   </p>\n\n<p>In my C++-biased brain it seems like using reference-counted smart pointers with deterministic destructors is a major step up from a garbage collector that requires you to implement IDisposable and call dispose to clean up your non-memory resources.  Admittedly, I'm not very smart...  so I'm asking this purely from a desire to better understand why things are the way they are. </p>\n\n<p>What if C# were modified such that:</p>\n\n<p>Objects are reference counted.  When an object's reference count goes to zero, a resource cleanup method is called deterministically on the object, then the object is marked for garbage collection.  Garbage collection occurs at some non-deterministic time in the future at which point memory is reclaimed.  In this scenario you don't have to implement IDisposable or remember to call Dispose.  You just implement the resource cleanup function if you have non-memory resources to release.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why is that a bad idea?</li>\n<li>Would that defeat the purpose of the garbage collector?</li>\n<li>Would it be feasible to implement such a thing?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EDIT:\nFrom the comments so far, this is a bad idea because </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>GC is faster without reference counting </li>\n<li>problem of dealing with cycles in the object graph</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think number one is valid, but number two is easy to deal with using weak references.</p>\n\n<p>So does the speed optimization outweigh the cons that you: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>may not free a non-memory resource in a timely manner </li>\n<li>might free a non-memory resource too soon</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If your resource cleanup mechanism is deterministic and built-in to the language you can eliminate those possibilities.</p>\n",
