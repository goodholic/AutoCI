  "question": "How to optimize performance when using Godot 고급 in Python?",
  "answer": "## Description\nI'm using Godot 고급 in Python, and I'm trying to optimize the performance of my game. I have tried to optimize my code, but I can't seem to get the desired results.\n\nIs there a specific way to optimize performance when using Godot 고급 in Python?\n\n## Response\nOptimizing the performance of a game using Godot 고급 in Python involves several strategies, including:\n\n1. **Leverage built-in optimizations**: Godot 고급 comes with a set of built-in optimizations that can help improve performance. These include features like batching, instancing, and scene tree culling.\n\n2. **Use data structures efficiently**: Efficient use of data structures can significantly improve performance. For example, using lists instead of arrays can reduce memory usage and increase speed.\n\n3. **Limit the number of objects**: Try to limit the number of objects in your game. More objects can slow down performance.\n\n4. **Avoid unnecessary computations**: Any computation that doesn't need to be done can be avoided. This can be done by reducing the number of calculations or by using more efficient algorithms.\n\n5. **Leverage multithreading**: If your game requires heavy calculations, multith",
