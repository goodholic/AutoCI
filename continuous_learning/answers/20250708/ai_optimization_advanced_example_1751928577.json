  "answer": "# AI and Machine Learning\n\n## AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term that refers to machines or software that are designed to exhibit characteristics of intelligence, such as understanding, problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into two types:\n\n1. Narrow AI: These are systems designed for a particular task, such as voice recognition or facial recognition.\n2. General AI: These are systems that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.\n\n## Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that provides systems the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to perform the task.\n\nMachine Learning can be categorized into three types:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, and it is expected to perform well on unseen data.\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset and it tries to find patterns and structures in the data.\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment, taking actions, and receiving rewards or penalties.\n\n# Context Management\n\nContext Management is a process in computer programming that involves the allocation of",
