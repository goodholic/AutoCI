  "question": "[게임 엔진 플러그인 개발 상황] Debug LINQ, async related issues in C# 고급 기능 code.",
  "answer": "A:\nI'm currently working on a project where the objective is to develop a game engine plugin using advanced C# features like LINQ, async/await, execution contexts, data storage, etc. I'm also trying to solve complex problems related to these topics.\n\n- I'm currently focusing on the use of C#'s static type system and functional programming aspects.\n\n- I've encountered complex issues related to LINQ, async, and other related topics, and I'm trying to solve them progressively.\n\n- I'm also looking into how to optimize my code and make it more efficient, especially in terms of memory usage and performance.\n\n- I'm also considering the possibility of using more advanced C# features in the future, especially those related to concurrency and parallelism.\n\n- I'm learning a lot from the community and I'm eager to share my knowledge and help others who might be facing similar challenges.\n\n- I'm using a mixture of unit tests, debugging, and logging to help me understand and debug the code.\n\n- I'm also looking into using profiling tools to help me identify bottlenecks and optimize my code.\n\n- I'm also learning about the use of modern C# features like records and top-level statements to improve my code's design and readability.\n\n- I'",
