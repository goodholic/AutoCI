  "answer": "Consistency is key.\n\n## What is the difference between a script and a scene in Godot?\n\n- A script is a piece of code that can be attached to a node in the scene tree. It is used to control the behavior of the node, such as handling user input, updating the node's properties, and interacting with other nodes.\n- A scene, on the other hand, is a hierarchical collection of nodes and resources, which can be used as a blueprint for creating similar objects. It's a way to organize and reuse game objects and their behavior.\n\n## What are the pros and cons of using scripts and scenes in Godot?\n\n### Scripts\n\nPros:\n1. Flexibility: Scripts allow for a high degree of flexibility and customization. They can be written in any language that compiles to C#, including Python and JavaScript, which can make prototyping and development faster.\n2. Code Reusability: Scripts can be reused across different scenes, making it easier to maintain and update code.\n3. Real-time editing: Scripts can be edited and tested in real-time, without the need to restart the game or reload the scene.\n\nCons:\n1. Complexity: Scripts can be more complex to write and debug than scenes, especially for large projects.\n2. Performance: Scripts are",
