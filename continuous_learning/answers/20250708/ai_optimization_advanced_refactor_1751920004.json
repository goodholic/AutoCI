  "question": "Improve Chaining, ContextManagement, FineTuning implementation in AI 고급 최적화 following SOLID principles.",
  "answer": "## SOLID Principles\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.\n\n2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.\n\n3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.\n\n4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use.\n\n5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n\n## AI Techniques\n\n1. Chaining: Chaining is a design pattern that allows us to chain together several actions in a row, each action being dependent on the result of the previous one. This pattern is useful in scenarios where several actions need to be performed in sequence.\n\n2. Context Management: Context management is a way to ensure that resources are properly released after they are no longer needed, even if an error occurs. This is done by using a context manager, which is an object that manages the setup and teardown of resources.\n\n3. Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning refers to the process of optimizing the performance of a system",
