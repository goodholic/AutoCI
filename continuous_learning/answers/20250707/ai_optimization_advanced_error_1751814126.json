  "question": "Common PromptEngineering, FineTuning errors in AI 고급 최적화 and how to fix them.",
  "answer": "It seems like you are asking about how to fine-tune and optimize AI models using Hugging Face's Transformers library.\n\nIn your question, you mentioned \"FineTuning errors in AI\", but it's not clear what specifically you're referring to. Are you asking about issues with fine-tuning a model or optimizing it?\n\nIf you're asking about fine-tuning a model, here are some general steps:\n\n1. Load a pretrained model: Use the `from_pretrained` method to load a pretrained model.\n2. Prepare your data: You need to tokenize your data and prepare it in the format that your model expects.\n3. Fine-tune the model: Use your training data to fine-tune the model.\n4. Evaluate the model: Evaluate your model on a validation set.\n\nIf you're asking about optimizing a model, you might want to consider techniques like batch size, learning rate, and gradient accumulation steps, among others.\n\nIf you provide more specific details about the errors you're experiencing, I might be able to give more targeted advice.\n\nRegarding \"PromptEngineering\", it's not clear what you mean. Are you referring to the process of creating prompts for a model, or are you referring to issues with the model's performance with certain",
