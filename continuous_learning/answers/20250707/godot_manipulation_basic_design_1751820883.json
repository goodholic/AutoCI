  "answer": "## Abstract\n\nThe task is to propose design patterns for basic editor manipulation based on NodeCreation systems. The editor is expected to have the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a node-based system. The system should also be able to handle undo and redo operations.\n\n## Design Patterns\n\n### Node\n\nThe Node class represents a single node in the editor. This class should have properties like id, name, content, creationDate, etc. It should also have methods to get and set these properties.\n\n### NodeFactory\n\nThe NodeFactory class is responsible for creating new instances of the Node class. It can be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the factory is created.\n\n### NodeManager\n\nThe NodeManager class is responsible for managing all nodes in the editor. It should have methods to add, remove, update, and get nodes. It should also handle undo and redo operations.\n\n### Command\n\nCommand pattern can be used to implement undo and redo operations. The Command interface should have execute and undo methods. Concrete commands can be created to implement the specific operations like create, update, and delete.\n\n### NodeIterator\n\nAn iterator pattern can be used to traverse through the nodes in the editor. The NodeIterator interface can have methods to get the next node and check if",
