In Godot, the equivalent would be to use scenes and scripts.\n\n## Unity to Godot Migration\n\nLet's say we have a simple Unity project with a ball object that moves around the screen. We'll go through the steps to migrate this to Godot.\n\n### 1. Create a New Godot Project\n\nOpen Godot and create a new project.\n\n### 2. Create a New Scene\n\nIn Godot, we don't have nodes like in Unity. Instead, we work with scenes and scripts. Create a new scene (right-click in the Project panel and select New > Scene).\n\n### 3.
